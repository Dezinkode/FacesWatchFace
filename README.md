# Faces Watch Face
An Android Experiment - A simple face with personality

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MJonesDev/FacesWatchFace/master/StoreGraphic.png)

Faces is a demonstration of the Interactive Watch Face API for Android Wear, 
made as an Android Experiment. Based on your touch, Jake (the name of this face)
will emote in several different ways. This code can be used best to give insight on
creating watch faces with the Interactive Watch Face API, or just making a watch
face in general. 
(Note: This has NOT been tested on Round devices or emulators. Right now, it 
has only been tested on square devices)

Emotions:

Touch - Confused

Nothing/Touch Cancel - Happy

Tap - Laughing (Three Seconds)
